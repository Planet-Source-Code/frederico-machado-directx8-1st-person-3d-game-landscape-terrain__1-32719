You can use everything that you need,
but don't forget to give me some credit.

I want to thanks to all DirectX programmers in PSC.

**************************************************
 I need help to fix the sky, and it needs to look
 like the sky of TrueVision, but I don't know how
 to do that. If anyone knows, please help me.
 I've set the MAGFILTER to D3DTEXF_POINT (see in
 the RenderSky() sub in modLandscape) to fix the
 "mix" problem of the sky textures but the textures
 look horrible. Try to help me please!
 I've added support to load heightmaps to create
 custom landscapes, but I can't load a heightmap
 with more than 180x180 pixels, cause it lets the
 framerate too down, even for my (800mhz 32MB VGA)
 If you know how to fix it, please help me.
 We can't walk correctly through the terrain, it is
 a problem.
